# Reporting Security Issues

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Sidero Labs team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial response to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and a full announcement and may request additional information or guidance. The expected response time is within 3 business days, and the fix is expected to be delivered within 30 days.

## Supported Releases

The Sidero Labs team will only provide security updates for the two latest minor releases of Omni, unless you have a support contract that specifies otherwise. If you are using an older version of Omni, we recommend upgrading to the latest release.

For example, if the latest release is `v0.49.1`, the supported releases are `v0.48.x` and `v0.49.x`.
